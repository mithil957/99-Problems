This project is a collection of programming problems largely inspired by the orignal 99 Prolog problems.
Each problem has a description, test cases, and sometimes multiple different ways to solve the problem. 
The aim is to learn by understanding different ways to approach a problem. 

This collection includes both the classic problems and new problems. Each implemented using modern Python (3.13). 

Most of the problems are self contained, so you can start anywhere and they are tagged with a difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) which is searchable. You can also search for general tags like (List, Tree, Arithmetic, Logic, Graph, Pattern) if you would like to focus on a certain type of problem.


*Sorry for the misleading title, it is 65 questions currently. Eventually, it will be 99 problems.
